# Goals and Methods

## Goals
Analyze New York Times articles by topic and explore potential applications such as
- Building a recommendation system based on topic similarity;
- Evaluate trends in topics.

### The dataset
We will be working with a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryansingh0909/nyt-articles-21m-2000-present/data) maintained by Aryan Singh and updated daily, collecting information about all articles published on NYT since the year 2000. The data associated with each article includes
- Title;
- Headline;
- Abstract;
- URL;
- Section and page in which the article was published;
- Keywords.
We plan to restrict our attention specifically to articles from a relative short period of time, e.g., the last year or two.

### The stakeholders
As stakeholders for this project, we envision our team members (Ravi Tripathi, Touseef Haider, Ping Wan, Schinella D'Souza, Alessandro Malus√†, Craig Franze) and the New York Times.
